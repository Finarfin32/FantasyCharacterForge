# Fantasy Character Forge

Fantasy Character Forge is a tool that allows you to create unique characters for tabletop role-playing games or fantasy stories. This creator offers a unique combination of features that make the character creation process enjoyable and inspiring.

The main feature of this creator is the use of character cards. Each card contains different character statistics. You can easily select cards and view their descriptions.
One of the standout elements is the ability to upload an avatar. You can add your own photo or choose a graphic that represents the appearance of your character. This adds a personal touch and helps visualize their appearance.
The creator also allows you to export the created character to a PDF file. This makes it easy to save and share your character in a professional and readable format.

Additionally, the creator provides the option to fill in essential character information. You can enter their history, personality traits, and even abilities.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

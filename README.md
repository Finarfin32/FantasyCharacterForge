# Fantasy Character Forge

Fantasy Character Forge is a tool that allows you to create unique characters for tabletop role-playing games or fantasy stories. This creator offers a unique combination of features that make the character creation process enjoyable and inspiring.

The main feature of this creator is the use of character cards. Each card contains different character statistics. You can easily select cards and view their descriptions.
One of the standout elements is the ability to upload an avatar. You can add your own photo or choose a graphic that represents the appearance of your character. This adds a personal touch and helps visualize their appearance.
The creator also allows you to export the created character to a PDF file. This makes it easy to save and share your character in a professional and readable format.

Additionally, the creator provides the option to fill in essential character information. You can enter their history, personality traits, and even abilities.
